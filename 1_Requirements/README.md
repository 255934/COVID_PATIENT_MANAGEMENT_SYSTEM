The deadline is 16th of april and the project was started on 6th of april. The duration of the project is of 2 weeks roughly.

## Where:

Application will be running on desktops in hospitals of our client to store data locally on their system.

## How:
The application is written in C and no extra dependencies are required on the clients system.
